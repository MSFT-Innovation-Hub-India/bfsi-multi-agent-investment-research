Despite this growth, the net profit remains negative, projected at -\u20b90.50 Bn in FY25P, primarily due to high interest costs and depreciation\u30104:5\u2020source\u3011\u30104:2\u2020source\u3011. \n\nOperating cash flow is projected to strengthen, rising from \u20b93.68 Bn in FY24 to \u20b94.20 Bn in FY25, but high capex commitments result in only minimal free cash flow\u30104:7\u2020source\u3011\u30104:2\u2020source\u3011.

The interest coverage ratio at 0.71 signals considerable challenges in meeting interest obligations, as it is below the recommended threshold of 1. This raises concerns about refinancing risks, especially given the maturity of \u20b91.81 Bn in FY24 and anticipations of further increases in future years, requiring effective management strategies for repayment in an environment of weak profitability\u301019:1\u2020source\u3011\u301019:1\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe current liquidity ratio computed at 0.17 highlights potential liquidity strains with cash equivalents of \u20b91 Bn against short-term obligations. This ratio indicates a heavy reliance on short-term borrowing, accounting for 21.5% of total debt. Therefore, the firm's financial strategy must prioritize bolstering liquidity to ensure smooth operational cash flows while managing impending debts sustainably\u301019:1\u2020source\u3011\u301019:1\u2020source\u3011.",

With the overall airport traffic around 79.30 million and an average utilization of nearly 79%, there is a clear indication of operating leverage; the airports are positioned to capitalize on passenger growth but will need to manage expansion and enhance infrastructure to avoid bottlenecks in throughput\u301025:2\u2020source\u3011\u301025:10\u2020source\u3011.",

The current P/B ratio of 1.99x reflects a solid relationship to its net worth, yet it hints at potential market overvaluation risks due to high leverage and operational losses\u301039:13\u2020source\u3011\u301039:8\u2020source\u3011. To justify its current EV, management requires an EBITDA of approximately \u20b98.19 Bn (15x multiple), which greatly overshadows the projected EBITDA of \u20b90.69 Bn.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, the dashboard outlines critical vulnerabilities, particularly high financial and execution risks associated with unfavorable interest coverage of 0.71x and a substantial capital expenditure program of \u20b932 Bn\u301039:11\u2020source\u3011\u301039:12\u2020source\u3011.
