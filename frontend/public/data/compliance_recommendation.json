  "section_4_final_recommendation": "**Decision Line:** REVIEW REQUIRED\n\nJustification Paragraph: GMRAIRPORT.NS meets the traded criteria as it has a total 30-day traded value of \u20b96,688.08 Cr (stock_report.liquidity.total_traded_value_cr_30d) and a traded volume of 56,037,950 shares (stock_report.liquidity.total_traded_volume_30d), surpassing the policy thresholds. The price provenance is valid since the stock is traded on the NSE (stock_report.exchange). However, there are possible exceptional events, specifically related to credit stress indicators (company_analysis_output.credit_stress_indicators) and missing debt valuer information (company_analysis_output.debt_valuer_name), which need further review before final acceptance.\n\nMandatory Fixes:\n\u2022 Clarify the financial position regarding the interest coverage ratio.\n\u2022 Obtain empaneled debt valuer details to adhere to valuation policy requirements.",
